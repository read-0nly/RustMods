## Cobalt-OS 

### A platform for mod exposure, an internet for computer stations

- Computer stations spawn a phone on the desk
- When a datatape is loaded, mounting the computer station launches the cassette's app
- When no datatape is loaded, the last number called is used as a destination
- if that phone has a datatape (a cassette tied to an app), that phone's app is launched for the mounting player
  - This is analong to pre-internet modem-to-modem connections and BBS
- The linker app allows for the creation of multi-service endpoints with navigation - the linker app loads the contacts of the phone the tape is in, and allows the connecting player to click on the name of the contact to have their connection re-routed to that phone's tape. With a collection of phones you can be an in-game sysadmin hosting a server that serves multiple services.
- Big potential for puzzles, I think 
- This is just the base mod - look at the COS-* folders for datatapes that integrate with this. Power station engineer also requires this mode (and powertransmission, though this doesn't require powertransission)
- Calling the panels of other mods is easy to integrate - look at COS-GuiShop for an example that, when placed alongside this and GuiShop, will allow players to access the shop using a datatape at a computer station, for a diegetic integration akin to something like ebay
