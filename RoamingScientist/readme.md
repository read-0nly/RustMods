##Roaming Scientists

###Incredibly not ready for use. Active development

Spawns scientists that roam the road and attack as a group when aggro'd. They seek out junkpiles for cover, chase aggressively, and will maneuver from cover to cover over time

Command to spawn them:
SpawnRoamer

They spawn at the point you're looking at. Some invisible things interact with the ray - if they're floating go somewhere else and try again
